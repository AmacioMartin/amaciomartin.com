        <ol>
            <li>Have a good semester</li>
            <li>Graduate</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My short term goal is to have a good semester. I didn't do to well in college my first time out so I want to
            take it a semester at a time and focus on doing my work. To achive this goal I believe that if I focus on
            the goal at hand, be on top of my work, and get help when I need it I believe that will allow me a achieve this goal. 
        </p>
        <p>My long term goal is to graduate and achieve a degree in Computer Gaming and Simulation. If I hone in on my
            short term goals of focusing on one semester at a time a doing my best then I should be able to achieve my
            goal. I believe that achieving my long term goal would allow me to get better jobs and work towards my long
            term goals that our further out, like starting a business and buying a home.
