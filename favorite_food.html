            MY FAVORITE FOOD
        </h1>
        <P>
            I really like seafood, so a my top five foods will contain mostly seafood. My top five foods are fish,
            crabs, shrimp, lamb, and chicken. My favorite food would have to be crab. My favorite way for crabs to be
            cooked is as crab cakes, they taste really good and can be cooked in various ways. Also you can eat crab
            cakes by themselves or make into a sandwich, it is a really versatile food.
        </P>
        <p>I have only made crab cakes a handful of times but below is a recpie I used to make my own at home</p>
