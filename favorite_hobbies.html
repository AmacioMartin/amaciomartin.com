            MY FAVORITE HOBBIES
        </h1>
        <P>
            I have a lot of hobbies that I am interested in. My top five hobbies are playing videogames, sports,
            exercising, watching anime, and making art. The hobbies that I engage in the most are playing videogames and
            exercising. Most of my hobbies are things that've I've been doing since I was a child and they just carried
            over into my adult life.
        </P>
        <p> Playing videogames is my favorite hobby and it has been since I was a kid and I even have dreams
            of becoming a videogame designer. I play videogames a lot and I am very interested into the inner workings
            of the videogames industry, how games are made, marketed, etc. Right now I am going back to school to get my
            degree in game design so that I can gain the skills to start a career in the industry and hopefully, one
            day, make my own games.
        </p>

        <p>My second favorite hobby is exercising. Like playing videogames, exercising has been a hobby of mine since I
            was a child. I always watched action movies as a kid and I always thought that when I got older I wanted to
            look like the guys in those movies. Also I always liked being active and playing sports as a kid and I
            always knew that exercising and getting stronger would make me a better athlete. Lastly I like to exercise
            because </p>
